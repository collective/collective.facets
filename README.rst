Introduction
============

Provide a UI for site administrators to add additional fields to classify their content.
Fields are additional keyword fields added to the categorisation tab of all types which
have the standard dublin-core metadata in your site. All fields are available to be used
in criteria for collections and viewable in the tabular view of a collection.
These field values aren't viewable on the item itself and aren't included in the html head metadata fields. They are
designed to aid in internal organisation of content only.

Functionality
=============
A site administrator can:

 - Add a new facet
 - Remove a facet
 - Rename a facet (#TODO)
 - Edit the description and label which will appear on /edit and also on collections
 - Make a facet required (#TODO)
 - Make a facet have an enforced vocabulary, perhaps via ATVocabularyManager (#TODO)
 - Rename values (#TODO)

Compatibility
=============
Currently only works with in Plone 4.2 with new style collections and Archetypes.
