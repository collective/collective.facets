Introduction
============

Provide a UI for site administrators to add additional fields to classify their content.
Fields are additional keyword fields added to the categorisation tab of all types which have the standard
dublin-core metadata in your site. All fields are available to be used in criteria for collections and viewable
in the tabular view of a collection.
These field values aren't viewable on the item itself and aren't included in the html head metadata fields. They are
designed to aid in internal organisation of content only.

A site administrator can:

 - Add a field
 - Remove a field #TODO
 - Rename a field #TODO
 - Edit the description and label which will appear on /edit and also on collections (#TODO)
 - Make a field required (#TODO)
 - Make a field have an enforced vocabulary, perhaps via ATVocabularyManager (#TODO)
 - Rename values (#TODO)
